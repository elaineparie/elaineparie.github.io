My brain was far more erratic when starting the rails project compared to my previous projects. I wasn't sure exactly what I wanted my app to be, and even when I decided that, I couldn't nail down the perfect model structure. At first I wanted routines and members to have a many-to-many relationship. 

My intent was to create a workout app that mimicked the structure of Spotify. A person could create a workout, publish it publicly and other members could follow that workout if they enjoyed it (much like you would do with playlists in Spotify).

My system was failing though - how could I keep one member from editing another member's routine if this was my structure? 

In the end, a routine belongs to a member and I'm currently in the works of allowing a member to add the workout to their own list...though I may need some help with this. 

I am content with the result of my project because it us an application that I would love to use. I kept this in the forefront of my mind while developing it. I want to take this idea and expand it until it is beautiful and functional.
