Especially for those who are fresh off the bootcamp grind, I know things kind of seem to derail. In the bootcamp, you are given so much instruction, your labs are set up for you, and you never really face the terror of looking at a blank screen. 
However, if you are interviewing for junior developer positions, you are going to want to run through some practice problems on your own! So here is the simplest way to do so. 

Open terminal and find folder in which you want to create a new project 

Run command: `mkdir <Practice_Sheet>`
cd <Practice_Sheet>
Create file called `practice.rb`
I would recommend adding `require ‘pry’` at the top to test your methods 
Start coding!
To run your methods, type command: `ruby practice.rb` (or whatever you filename is)

Good Luck!
