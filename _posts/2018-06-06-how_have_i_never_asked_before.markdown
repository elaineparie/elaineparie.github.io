If you had asked me a few months ago, I would have confidently told you that the web and internet are synonymous. The internet connects browsers to servers and vice versa. The web is an application of the internet where servers and clients can exchange information. How do they do this? They communicate through HTTP which requests information from the server and sends it to the browser without processing its actual information. 

The actual *language* of the web is HTML which is how everybody must publish content on a web server - through an HTML document.

So, it turns out that the internet is not such a magical place, but a system of information exchange communicated through specific languages!
