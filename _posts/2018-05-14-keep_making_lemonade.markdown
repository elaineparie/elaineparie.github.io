I was underqualified at 18 to decide my path in life. Not as insult to myself, but it was impossible to comprehend the intricacies life would bring and how my priorities would change. I spent some time scorning the naivety of that young girl and then decided to stop wasting time. Though life may sometimes seem rigid, it is easily changeable. It didn’t take me long to begin carving a new path. 

A couple of notes about myself: (1) I went to school for writing (2) I love editing (3) I am a ballroom dancer. Though these facts seem unrelated to computer coding, they greatly influenced my decision to begin. 

As a writer, I haven’t been forced to engage my left side brain for some time. As a person who thrived in math, it felt wasteful. Also, after much time spent with creativity and opinion, I craved the assurance of a “right” answer. 
Coding is a lot like editing. Everything must be perfectly written in order for the code to function. I view it as perfectly beautiful prose. 
I practice ballroom dancing with my partner almost every day for a couple hours and I plan to dance pro within the coming year. Because programming can be sometimes done remotely, I hope it fits in with the flow of my life and the inconsistencies of my days. 

There are many more small influencers of my decision, but those were the major players. I look forward to accomplishing this new feat, to using both sides of my brain equally and to continue challenging the rigidity of life.
