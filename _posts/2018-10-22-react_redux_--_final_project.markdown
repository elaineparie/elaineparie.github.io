There were days I was terribly frustrated about this project and the future of it looked bleak. However, I kept pushing, trying to understand more about the way React and Redux work. Finally, it began to make sense. I certainly know far more now than at the beginning of the project. It is true, twhen one is forced to rise to an occasion, they usually do and become better for it.

Your-Story is a blog site intended for daily journaling, much like an online diary. I found throughout my life, when I give each day (even if it may seem a mundane day) the time and attention of my writing, my life experience is enhanced. I suddenly want to create an interesting story for my work. However, I find that writing in a journal can sometimes be slower and impractical if I really want to publish work. Your-Story fixes these problems.
