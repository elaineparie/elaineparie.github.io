Javascript and I did not get along well at first. I missed the simplicity and format of Rails. So I dragged my feet to begin the project. 

However, as things got going, I seemed to start clicking concepts into place. All of a sudden I had a better grasp on how and when to use Javascript. 

I was excited the assignment was to improve our Rails project because I felt stuck on a few features when I was working on it in the Rails section. For instance, I wanted a way to add an exercise form to the routine page and have it refresh to add endless exercises. With JS, this was easy!  (Well...possible).

However, there was one feature that was definitely an uphill battle. I first wanted to move through Routine show pages using the show endpoint. This was not functioning properly. With the help of David, we reconstructed the JavaScript to use the index endpoint. Figuring out this code was not easy for me and ended up being more crowded than I hoped it would be. Nevertheless, it works properly so I am pleased about that.
