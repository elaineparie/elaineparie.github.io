I felt like I was walking through a room blindfolded. I thought I would have someone guide me, but it turned out, I was alone. 
I created an email parsing Ruby gem. I had a faint idea about how to get started, but could not conjure up a solid plan of action. I thought Iâ€™d refer out for help. However, when help did not show up, I took one baby step at a time, feeling my way through the room slowly. 
First, I figured out how to set up the directory. Then (my biggest challenge) how to import files. Then how to parse these files with methods and how to make an interactive CLI. 
As you can probably tell, I did a lot of figuring out! I was amazingly proud of myself by the end of the project. I realized that by being alone in this journey, I was forced to understand a lot of things I never thought I would. Asking for help and having mentors is great, but I know now not to jump the gun. My brain gains a deeper understanding when I uncover the path myself rather than being guided. 
There is definitely a time and a place to ask for help, but I believe now that I am my own best teacher.
