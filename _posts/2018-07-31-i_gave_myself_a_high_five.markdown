I was actually impressed at the speed and understanding I had of the material while working on my Sinatra project. It came together rather quickly and I knew the logic behind each step. 

This all surprised me because I was previously struggling with some of the Sinatra material and I was glad it clicked right in time. 

I am pleased with my finished product. I think there are more features I could add, but it does it's job -- organizes the user's life by different to-do lists. Contained in the lists are tasks ordered from most important to least important. When the user completes a task, it can be removed using the delete route which is labeled "Completed Task."
